To learn to code i need to solve problems with code, not just read and know the meaning of the words and contstructs, I will try to do inaddition to the memrise drills one or two problems a day and one project per week, 


So I already use memrise to learn what certain things mean and some theory and some coding, I was using enki and that was good but need to make actual code from my head to solve problems so I will use thses

things like this

The parameter weekday is True if it is a weekday, and the parameter vacation is True if we are on vacation. We sleep in if it is not a weekday or we're on vacation. Return True if we sleep in.

solution

def sleep_in(weekday, vacation):
  if not weekday or vacation:
    return True
  else:
    return False
    
 But as I walked away I thought I should actually just use Jupypter Notebooks
